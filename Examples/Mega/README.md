## These examples 

- Are being reworked at the end of August to use the user_config for setting up the Node IDs and the factory resets.
- The output version offer multiple events to be taught to each pin on the Mega.
- The 63 input is now added to the examples.
- The I/O example only allows for one event to be taught to each output pin. This I plan to look at changing over the next few weeks as I feel it may be better to have 24 pins as inputs and 24 pins as outputs.
- Can bus examples added for testing purposes only at this stage.

- The sketch that use the fire effect can only use the folowing 7 sets of PWM pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 44, 45, We will look at making it so that they appear seperatly from the other effects, when rewrite the final sketches.
