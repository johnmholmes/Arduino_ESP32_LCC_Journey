## These examples 

- Are being reworked at the end of August to use the user_config for setting up the Node IDs and the factory resets.
- The output version offer multiple events to be taught to each pin on the Mega.
- The I/O example only allows for one event to be taught to each output pin. This I plan to look at changing over the next few weeks as I feel it may be better to have 24 pins as inputs and 24 pins as outputs.
