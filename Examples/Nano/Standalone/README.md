# Arduino Nano R3 ATmega328PB

The old repository had some examples that really had no suitable use, So I have removed them until I can give a good user case.

- I have settled on 4 servos in this range, it would be easy to change this number in the future. 
However careful consideration for the powering of the servos needs looking at by the end user.
