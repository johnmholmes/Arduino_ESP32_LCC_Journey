# Arduino Nano R3 ATmega328PB

This Arduino Nano is the first MCU I investigated for use within LCC. While it does have limited memory it has proven to still offer some use for smaller layouts. 

- The example sketches in these folders offer Can bus and standalone Nodes.
- For more complexe functionality you would need to look at an alternative MCU.
- The other folders cover the Arduino Mega, Arduino R4 Nano, and the ESP32.

## OpenLCB_Single_Thread

- All examples require the installation of the OpenLCB_Single_Thread library to work.

## September 2025 Update

I have reworked the examples with some minor changes from the previous versions. 


- The NoCan have been called Standalone, and the number of examples cut down to help with future maintainability.
- These changes will possibly be the last changes I make to them as I will be looking at using the Arduino R4 Nano clones once they become available from China. 
This has a number of advantages for more functionallity to be added.
- Please if you have any issues with them let me know, so I can fix them.
