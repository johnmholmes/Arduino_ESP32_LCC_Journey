# Arduino_LCC_Journey

Page updated 1/11/24

## The sketches have been updated to ensure they work with the next library full release.
----

## The Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 are being pushed to there limits and may not be the best hardware to use!

The may be some minor changes required over the next few days as I retest then incase I find any bugs.


This repository is used to document my journey into using the Arduino LCC library examples. [here](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Single_Thread) Thanks to David Harris for making this possible for me.

- All credit goes to the library creators who have also helped me to get this going on an Arduino Nano using the MCP2515 modules, and use the MERG CANUSB4 to interface it with JMRI.
- I will be using the Wiki feature rather than the readme file, so please click on the tab to open it.

### The current test sketch is added but this is still a work in progress.
