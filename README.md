# Arduino Nano LCC Journey

## Page updated 15/11/24

----
## We now have 4 versions of the AVR2ServoNIO sketch 

The main library as produced by David Harris I have now uploaded 4 versions for people to use with an Arduino Nano.

----

- This repository will primarily focus on the Arduino Nano and Mega families of boards, as well as the MCP2515 CAN module.
- I have just added a second sketch for 4 servos and 8 I/O building on Davids library version 0.1.4

----

## The Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 are being pushed to there limits and may not be the best hardware to use!

- My goal is to present a selection of examples dedicated to the Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 module.
- In the future you will see me looking at maybe the ESP32.
- I will also colaberate with another MERG member to cover the Pi Pico versions.

----

## This repository is used to document my journey into using David's LCC library [examples](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Single_Thread) Thanks to David Harris for making this possible for me.

- All credit goes to the library creators who have also helped me to get this going on an Arduino Nano using the MCP2515 modules, and use the MERG CANUSB4 to interface it with JMRI.
- Also we can use the example to create stand alone animation modules using just a USB lead.
- I will be using the Wiki feature rather than the readme file, so please click on the Wiki tab to open it.

## Version 0.1.5
