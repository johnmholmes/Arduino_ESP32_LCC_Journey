# Arduino_LCC_Journey
 This is used to document my journey into using the Arduino LCC library examples.

- All credit goes to the library creators who have also helped me to get this going on an Arduino Nano using the MCP2515 modules, and use the MERG CANUSB4 to interface it with JMRI.
- I will be using the Wiki feature rather than the readme file, so please click on the tab to open it.

### The current test sketch is added but this is still a work in progress.
