# Arduino_LCC_Journey

Page updated 4/11/24

## We have an issue with the examples at the moment, with some changes we have made in the last week. Which has caused some strange things to happen with the module. 

- If you are using version 0.1.0 the two example files will compile now. AVR2ServoNIO & AVR2ServoNIO_NoCan

----

## The Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 are being pushed to there limits and may not be the best hardware to use!

- As David developes the Libraries we may end up with some new bugs. It is important to understand he his doing this so people can use various different MCU and Can modules.
- My goal is to present a selection of examples dedicated to just 1 MCU and 1 Type of Can module.


This repository is used to document my journey into using the Arduino LCC library examples. [here](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Single_Thread) Thanks to David Harris for making this possible for me.

- All credit goes to the library creators who have also helped me to get this going on an Arduino Nano using the MCP2515 modules, and use the MERG CANUSB4 to interface it with JMRI.
- I will be using the Wiki feature rather than the readme file, so please click on the tab to open it.

### The current test sketch is added but this is still a work in progress.
