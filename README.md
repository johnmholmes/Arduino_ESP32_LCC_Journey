# Arduino Nano LCC Journey

## Page updated 8/11/24

----

## Sketch AVR2ServoINO CAN version will only work if you change over the interrupt from pin 3 to pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.

----

## We are looking at just having one version of AVR2ServoNIO sketch in the next full release.

- This repository will primarily focus on the Arduino Nano and Mega families of boards, as well as the MCP2515 CAN module.

----

## The Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 are being pushed to there limits and may not be the best hardware to use!

- My goal is to present a selection of examples dedicated to the Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 module.
- In the future you will see me looking at maybe the ESP32.
- I will also colaberate with another MERG member to cover the Pi Pico versions.

----

## This repository is used to document my journey into using David's Arduino LCC library examples. [here](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Single_Thread) Thanks to David Harris for making this possible for me.

- All credit goes to the library creators who have also helped me to get this going on an Arduino Nano using the MCP2515 modules, and use the MERG CANUSB4 to interface it with JMRI.
- Also we can use the example to create stand alone animation modules using just a USB lead.
- I will be using the Wiki feature rather than the readme file, so please click on the tab to open it.

## Version 0.1.4

This was released 7/11/2024, and has 3 versions of the AVR2ServoNIO sketch The next release will drop this down to one version. Which will make it simplier for me to document the journey. I have already added the latest version into my repository. If in the future we come up with more features that could be used on the Arduino Nano, I will then update the repsitory.
