# Arduino LCC Journey

Page updated 5/11/24

## As we develop sketches and the main library progresses through official releases, some sketches may be affected. It's important to note that David's library is designed to support a variety of different MCUs, CAN modules, and communication protocols.

- This repository will primarily focus on the Arduino Nano and Mega families of boards, as well as the MCP2515 CAN module.

- If you are using version 0.1.0 the two example files will compile now. AVR2ServoNIO & AVR2ServoNIO_NoCan see the folder marked Examples_0_1_0 .

----

## The Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 are being pushed to there limits and may not be the best hardware to use!

- My goal is to present a selection of examples dedicated to the Arduino Nano and the MCP2515 module.
- In the future you will see me looking at maybe the ESP32.
- I will also colaberate with another MERG member to cover the Pi Pico versions.

----

This repository is used to document my journey into using David's Arduino LCC library examples. [here](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Single_Thread) Thanks to David Harris for making this possible for me.

- All credit goes to the library creators who have also helped me to get this going on an Arduino Nano using the MCP2515 modules, and use the MERG CANUSB4 to interface it with JMRI.
- Also we can use the example to create stand alone animation modules using just a USB lead.
- I will be using the Wiki feature rather than the readme file, so please click on the tab to open it.

### Different examples folders

- I will break down the folder structure so you know which version of the library release it will work with, without having to make any major changes to the sketch.
